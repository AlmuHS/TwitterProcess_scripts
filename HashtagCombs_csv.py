'''This script generate a two columns text file, with the combinations two to two of tweets' hashtag
extracted from csv file

The csv file contains the hashtag list from differents tweets, with a tweet per line
The script performs the combinational of words two to two in each line from csv file, and copy the results in a new file

To execute in console, write: "python HashtagCombs_csv.py csvfile outputfile", replacing csvfile with your csv name 
and outputfile with your output file name

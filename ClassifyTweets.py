This script classify a tweet set, using key words setted previously as support or reject words extracted from two files.
The support file contains the list of support hashtags, with a hashtag per line
The reject file is similar to support file, but with reject hashtags.

The tweet set is getted from a csv file, which contains the tweet identifier, the text, and your hashtag list, separated with spaces

The script read the hashtag list of each tweet, and set a code to this, based in the contents of your hashtag list
The possible codes are: 1=support, 2=reject, 3=uncertain, 4=unclassificable

support = the tweet only contains hashtags of support file
reject = the tweet only contains hashtags of reject file
uncertains = the tweet contains hashtag of both files
unclassificable = the tweet don't contains any files hashtag

This code is written in a out file, which contains all columns of the csv file, and a new column with the code assigned for each tweet
